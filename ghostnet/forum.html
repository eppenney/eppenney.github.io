      <div class="content" id="p1">
        <p>Hello everyone. I‚Äôm back from an extended trip with my partner and have some things of interest to share. We travelled to a delightful campsite in the province of Nova Scotia, on Lake George with some friends. 
<br>Winter festivities aside, I had some downtime listening to the radio (if you haven‚Äôt read my blog ‚Äì fuck Spotify and all the ‚Äòstreaming‚Äô corporations like them.) I know that I said before I left that I would be taking a break from all this, but what I found was too interesting to pass up. While listening to some music, I started to get interference from some sort of local FM broadcast. Not unusual to be honest, plenty of churches broadcast over frequencies with higher power setups than they‚Äôre supposed to. 
<br>The thing is ‚Äì I can‚Äôt explain what it is that I heard. It sounded like a woman crying ‚Äì just quietly sobbing. I had to turn the volume up as loud as it could go to hear it. After about three minutes, the signal went dead. I noted the time, 9:03 PM. I monitored that same frequency, and at 9:30 PM exactly I caught it again. For three minutes, I could just barely hear a woman sobbing. With my headphones I was able to get some more detail. At 9:32:36 there was a sound like metal being hit underwater, and the voice said something. I can‚Äôt be sure, but it sounded like the name ‚ÄúMadeline‚Äù with the intonation of a question. 
<br>At this point, I was invested. I got my recording equipment from the car, and was an anti-social shut in for the rest of the night. At 10:00PM the signal came back. I was able to capture this recording. 
<br>I was chilled to say the least. I promised my partner that I would take a break from my research for this trip, so that was all I was able to capture. Let me know what you think! Has any else been up to Lake George? 
</p>

      <div class="content" id="p2">
        <p>I'm wondering if anyone has any experience using spirit boxes, like radios and stuff. 
          When I was younger I read this book at my Uncle's place called Breakout or something 
          like that and had a trippy zigzag cover. It was filled with all sorts of freaky transcripts of conversations these researchers 
          had with dead people. My uncle passed recently and the family has been looking through his things. 
          I can't find the book, he must have thrown it out or smth. I would love if anyone knows what 
          I'm talking about - we read it a lot together and it would be really special if I could find 
          a copy.

            <li><strong>FoggyNelson:</strong> I might have read something similar, but I think it was 
            called Voice Transmissions with the Deceased?</li>
            <li class="reply depth-1"><strong>Phasmoid:</strong> Just looked it up and unfortunatley I don't think
