                <p>This project was developed as part of my advanced graphics course during my final semester at UPEI. 
                    <br><br>
                    I implemented a particle system using linked list memory management to create a dynamic pool of particles, 
                    enabling efficient addition and removal as needed. The system was designed to be data-driven, allowing for 
                    easy expansion through XML without requiring additional code modifications. 
                    <br><br>
                    To demonstrate the system's versatility, I created two distinct visual effects: one featuring two emitters 
                    for smoke and fire, and another using a single emitter to generate fog. 
                    <br><br>
                    The entire project was built using C++ and OpenGL on top of a foundational engine called Wolf, 
                    with all particle, emitter, rendering, and shader code developed exclusively by me.

                <p>I have developed several Unity projects in my spare time and for game jams hosted on itch.io, showcasing my passion

                            <strong>Project Overview:</strong> Billy the Blueberry is a physics movement platform shooter where Billy combats small grubs and giant worms using a grappling hook that attaches to both enemies and environments. It features art all made by me, and was submitted for the GMTK game jam 2024.

                            During this project, I learned a lot about the pros and cons of physics-based movement, and had a lot of fun practicing making simple pixel art assets.

                                <strong>Project Overview:</strong> Oubliette features 3D graphics all made by me. I wanted to create a turn-based card game with minimal UI and a focus on in-game world UI elements. In this game, the player is stationary as the environment and enemies move around them.

                                I learned a lot about in-world UI with this project and how much it relies on animation and feedback. I got to use Blender extensively to make the assets for this project.

                                It is very buggy, but it was my first opportunity to apply my coding skills to a project I had imagined. This experience taught me a lot about feature creep as I attempted to implement quests, inventory, NPCs, and randomly generated locations—most of which had their fair share of bugs.

                                <strong>Project Overview:</strong> *Shinjitsu no Megane* is an experimental game where I explored alternative forms of animation and unique camera effects. By using pictures of myself and implementing layer masks, I was able to create alternative versions of environments, allowing for dynamic transitions between different realities. One of the key visual elements is an effect where the lenses of a pair of glasses reveal an alternate world as the player character dons them. This was achieved by carefully synchronizing the animation and mask transitions to enhance the player's sense of immersion and discovery.
